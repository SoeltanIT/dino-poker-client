## Ceme Keliling

<Section title='Game Introduction and Core Appeal'>
Ceme Keliling is a variation of **Ceme**, a popular betting game using domino tiles. 'Keliling' means **'Rotating'**, and the most significant feature is that all eligible players take turns serving as the dealer. The player's goal is to make the sum of just 2 domino tiles as close as possible to '9 points (Qiu)' to win against the round's dealer and claim the betting amount.

<Section title='Betting and Dealer Role Regulations'>
**Betting Method**: Players must complete their bets before receiving their tiles.

**Dealer Rotation (Keliling)**: The dealer role is performed by eligible players (those who meet the minimum dealer balance) on a round-by-round basis, rotating clockwise.

**Dealer Eligibility**: A player who wishes to be the dealer must possess the **Minimum Dealer Balance** set by the table.

</Section>

<Section title='Domino Tile Value Summation Rules (2 Tiles)'>
The final value that determines win or loss is the sum of the total dots shown on the two tiles.

**Score Summation**: Add up all the dots shown on the 2 tiles.
**Use of the Ones Digit**: If the total sum is a two-digit number (10 or higher), the tens digit is discarded, and only the ones digit is accepted as the final value. (Example: 15 points become 5 points; 19 points become 9 points).
**Highest Value**: Among the final values, 9 points is the highest and is called 'Qiu'.
