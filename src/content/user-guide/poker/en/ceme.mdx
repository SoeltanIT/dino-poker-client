## Ceme

<Section title='Game Introduction and Core Appeal'>
  Ceme is a fast-paced, dynamic betting game that uses only 2 domino tiles. The biggest feature of this game is that
  eligible players can take on the dealer role directly. Players aim to make the sum of their 2 tiles close to '9 points
  (Qiu)' and win the 1-on-1 battle against the dealer.

  Dealer Eligibility: If a player wishes to participate as the dealer, they must possess the Minimum Dealer Balance
  specified by the table.

<Section title='Domino Tile Value Summation Rules (2 Tiles)'>
Win or loss is determined by the sum of the total dots shown on the two tiles.

**Score Summation**: Add up the scores of the 2 tiles.

**Use of the Ones Digit**: If the total sum is 10 or more, the tens digit is discarded, and only the ones digit is accepted as the final value.

**Example**: [6|6] + [6|3] = 12 + 9 = 21. The final value becomes 1.

**Highest Value**: Among the final values, 9 points is the highest value and is called **'Qiu'**.
