## Format Introduction and Core Appeal

<Section title='Tournament'>
  A tournament is a competitive format where players who pay a fixed entry fee (buy-in) compete with the same starting
  chips (Starting Chips) to determine a single winner. Unlike regular cash games, chips are not directly linked to money
  and are only used as a tool for survival. As time passes, blind levels rise periodically, forcing players into
  aggressive play and maximizing tension and strategic depth.
