## Super Bull

<Section title='Game Introduction and Core Appeal'>
  Super Bull is a popular Asian card game also known as **Niu-Niu Poker**. Players receive 5 cards and must split them
  to make the sum of 3 cards a multiple of 10 (Bull), using the sum of the remaining 2 cards to determine the final
  score against the dealer. The ability to strategically divide the 5 cards determines the outcome, and the game
  features high rewards, such as receiving double the bet amount when achieving special hands like 'Bull Bull'.

  **Dealer Role**: The dealer rotates clockwise (circulates) for each round.

<Section title="Game Progression Steps and Card Splitting Rules">
Betting Completion: Before the game starts, the player decides and confirms the number of chips they will bet against the dealer. The 'Last Bet' feature can be used to bet the same amount as the previous round.

**Card Distribution**: Both the dealer and the player receive 5 cards.

**Card Splitting (Creating the Bull)**: The player must split the 5 cards into the following two groups:

- First Group (3 Cards): The sum of the 3 cards must be a multiple of 10 (Bull). (e.g., 10, 20, 30)
- Second Group (2 Cards): The sum of the remaining 2 cards determines the final score.

**Score Confirmation**: If the sum of the remaining 2 cards is 10 or more, only the ones digit is used as the final score.

Example: Sum of 3 cards is 30 (Bull) + Sum of remaining 2 cards is 9 (8+A) → Bull 9 Score

**Submission**: After completing the split, press the 'Go' button to confirm. The 'Hint' button can be used to automatically find a 3-card combination that creates a Bull.

**Showdown**: When the timer expires or everyone has submitted, the dealer's and player's cards are revealed, and the side with the higher Bull Score wins.

</Section>

<Section title="Final Win and Tie-Breaking Regulations">
1. **Winning Determination Method (Based on Bull Score)**<br />
  **Bull Bull (Highest Hand)**: When the sum of 3 cards is a multiple of 10, and the sum of the remaining 2 cards is also a multiple of 10.<br />
  The side with the higher Bull Score wins in the following order: Bull 9 > Bull 8 > ... > Bull 1 > No Bull.

2. **Special Reward Regulations**<br />
   **Upon winning with Bull Bull**: The player receives double the bet amount.<br />
   **Upon winning with Bull 8 or Bull 9**: The player receives double the bet amount.

3. **Tie-Breaking Regulations**<br />
   **If the Bull Score is identical**: The winner is determined by comparing the highest-ranked card among the 5 cards. (K is the highest rank, A is 1 point.)<br />
   **If the highest rank is also identical**: The winner is determined by comparing the suit of the highest-ranked card.<br />
   **Suit Ranking (Strongest to Weakest)**: Spade (♠) > Heart (♥) > Club (♣) > Diamond (♦)
