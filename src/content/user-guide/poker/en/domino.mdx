## Domino (Qiu Qiu)

<Section title='Game Introduction and Core Appeal'>
  Domino QQ (Qiu Qiu) is a popular Indonesian card game using 4 domino tiles. Players aim to divide their 4 received
  tiles into two pairs, with the goal of achieving the 'QQ (9-9)' hand where both pairs score '9 points (Qiu)'. The game
  combines betting strategy and psychological warfare, requiring players to form the strongest 'two-pair' combination
  against their opponents or the dealer.

<Section title='Betting and Fund Regulations'>
**Minimum/Maximum Buy-in**: Each table has a minimum and maximum entry amount (Buy-in) set, and players must participate within this range.

**Minimum Bet (Blind)**: Players must bet the minimum blind amount to stay in the game.

**All-in**: Players can bet their entire chip stack. The maximum bet is limited to the opponent's total chip stack.

**Insufficient Funds**: If a player's balance is insufficient, they must either Top-up or exit the game.

</Section>

<Section title='Domino Tile Value Summation Rules (QQ Game)'>
The 4 tiles are grouped into two pairs of 2 tiles each, and the score for each pair is calculated.

**Score Summation**: Sum the dots on the 2 tiles in each pair.

**Use of the Ones Digit**: If the total sum is a two-digit number (10 or more), the tens digit is discarded, and only the ones digit is accepted as the final value. (The maximum value is 9)

**Online System**: Without needing to count the dots, the system automatically calculates and displays the values of the 'Left Hand' and 'Right Hand,' with the Left Hand always being displayed as greater than or equal to the Right Hand.
