## Big Two / Capsa

<Section title='Game Introduction and Core Appeal'>
  Big Two, or Capsa, is a highly popular 'Shedding' type of card game in Asia. The objective is for a player to be the
  first to discard all 13 of their cards to win. The biggest characteristic of this game is that the card ranking is
  completely different from standard poker. The **2 (Two) is the most powerful card**, and the 3 is the weakest. Players
  must use poker combinations to play single cards, pairs, or five-card combinations that are stronger than the previous
  player's hand.
