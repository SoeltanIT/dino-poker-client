## Game Introduction and Core Appeal

<Section title="Omaha (Omaha Poker)">
Omaha Poker, like Texas Hold'em, uses 5 community cards, but it demands much greater strategic depth because each player receives 4 hand cards and the final hand combination rule is strict. It is a complex and intense game where players must use exactly 2 of their hand cards and 3 of the community cards.

Because of this strict combination rule, higher-ranking hands appear more frequently than in Hold'em.

<Section title='Final Victory and Tie-Breaker Rules'>
1. Determining the Winner

Best Hand: At showdown, the player with the highest 5-card hand made from 'exactly 2 of 4 hand cards' + 'exactly 3 of 5 community cards' wins the pot.
Winning by Bluffing: If all other players fold before the showdown, the last remaining player immediately wins the pot, regardless of their hand.

2. Tie (Chop) Rules

If two or more players have identical final 5-card hands, including the rank and all kicker cards, it is a tie (Chop).
In case of a tie, the total pot for that round is split equally among the tied players.

<Section title='Poker Hand Rankings (Omaha Poker Standard)'>
