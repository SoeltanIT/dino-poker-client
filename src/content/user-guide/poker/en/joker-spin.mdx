## Joker Spin

<Section title='Game Introduction and Core Appeal'>
  Joker Spin is a hybrid tournament format that combines the classic Texas Hold\'em game with a Joker Spin slot machine
  feature. At the start of the game, a slot machine spins to determine a **Random Multiplier Bonus**, which dictates the
  size of that tournament’s total Prize Pool. Players follow standard Hold\'em rules, but hitting a high multiplier (up
  to 40,000x) gives them the chance to win a massive prize with just a single buy-in.

<Section title='Joker Spin Working Principle (Multiplier Bonus)'>
* **Slot Operation**: At the beginning of the game, the Joker Spin slot machine rotates to generate a random card combination.

- **Multiplier Determination**: The Multiplier Bonus value is determined based on the slot result. (Example: Achieving 5 of a Kind results in 10,000x)

- **Prize Pool Setting**: The total prize pool is set as: Total Buy-in Amount × Determined Multiplier Value. (Example: Buy-in 10,000 × 40,000x = 400,000,000)

</Section>

<Section title='Tournament Structure and Blinds'>
**Entry Method**: After selecting the buy-in amount and registering in the lobby, the game starts once enough players are fulfilled by the matchmaking system.

**No Rebuy**: If a player loses all their chips before the end of the game, they are immediately eliminated and cannot re-enter with an additional payment.

**Prize Winning Condition**: Players must reach at least a High Ranking Position to receive a winning prize.

**Game End**: The game ends when only one player remains.

</Section>

<Section title='Blind and Time Structure'>
The blind structure (Ante, Blind Level, Time Bank) varies depending on the Joker Spin result (Multiplier value) and has a unique structure for each game type (Joker Spin 3, Joker Spin 6, All In or Fold).

**Blind Level Increase**: Each blind level consistently increases at set time intervals (e.g., 2 minutes, 3 minutes, 4 minutes, etc.).
