## Super10

<Section title="Game Introduction and Core Appeal">
Super10 is a simple yet strategic card game inspired by the traditional Indonesian game Samgong (or Three Pictures). The goal is to sum the values of 3 cards to get as close as possible to the number '10', focusing on competition among players.

The game progresses quickly with only two deals and two betting rounds. High-ranking hands and the suit rank in case of a tie have a decisive impact on the outcome.

<Section title='Card Value Summation Rules (Important)'>
J, Q, K Cards: Each is counted as 10.

A Card: Counted as 1.

2 ~ 10 Cards: Counted as the number indicated on the card.

Summation Rule: If the sum of the 3 card values is a two-digit number (e.g., 17), only the last digit (the ones place) is recognized as the final value. (e.g., 17 becomes 7, 30 becomes 0)

</Section>

<Section title='Final Win and Tie-Breaking Regulations'>

1. Winning Determination Method
   Highest Value: The player with the highest final card value sum wins. (The highest value is 10.)

   Special Hands: A player with a special hand ranking takes precedence over the general value summation ranking.

2. Tie-Breaking and Rank Criteria
   If two or more players have the same highest value, the winner is determined in the following order:

   Highest Card: Among the tied players, the player with the highest-ranked card among their 3 hand cards wins. (K > A in strength, while J, Q, and K are all equally high cards.)

Highest Suit: If the rank of the hand cards is also identical, the player with the highest suit card wins.

Suit Ranking (Strongest to Weakest): Spade (♠) > Heart (♥) > Club (♣) > Diamond (♦)

</Section>

<Section title='Super10 Hand Rankings (Strongest First)'>
Instead of general poker hands, Super10 determines the ranking based on the summation and combination of card values.
