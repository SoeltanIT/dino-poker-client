## QQ Spirit

<Section title='Game Introduction and Core Appeal'>
  QQ Spirit is a betting game that uses domino tiles, featuring a unique format combining the goal of Baccarat with the
  choice system of Blackjack. Players aim to make the sum of their tiles as close as possible to 9 points (Qiu) against
  the dealer. Notably, the player has enhanced strategic action choices, such as deciding to double the bet (Double) or
  whether to take a third tile after receiving the second, adding strategic depth.

<Section title="Dealer Role Regulations (Fixed Table vs. Regular Table)">
**FIXED Table**: On 'FIXED' tables, the player seated in the **Top Position** performs the role of the permanent dealer.

**Regular Table**: On regular tables, the dealer role rotates clockwise every 3 periods or when the current dealer leaves or runs out of capital.

</Section>

<Section title="Domino Tile Value Summation Rules">
The final value that determines win or loss is decided by the total sum of dots on the tiles.

**Use of the Ones Digit**: If the total sum is a two-digit number (10 or more), the tens digit is discarded, and only the ones digit is accepted as the final value.

**Highest Value**: 9 points is the highest final value and is called 'Qiu'.
